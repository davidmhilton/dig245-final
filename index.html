                    While a simple design on the surface, this fortune cookie generator operates on mathematical methods that are used in large language models (LLMs).
                     We sought to create a text generation application that uses an underlying database to determine the user experience.
                     After experimenting with different generative goals, we landed on using a database to generate fortunes that you might find 
                     inside your cookie.
                </p>
                <p>  
                    Using python data scraping tools, we pulled all of our information from 
                     <a href="http://www.fortunecookiemessage.com/archive.php?start=">Fortune Cookie Messages</a> 
                     which is a database of fortunes that individuals have found in their cookies and submitted to the forum. This was intriguing
                     to us as the data is derived (or so they say) from real world fortunes. Once all of this data was collected, it was transferred
                     to a json object which can then be processed by our application. This is where the mathematical model used by LLMs comes into 
                     play. We use the input data to ‘train’ dictionaries in our code that will then be used to generate predictive output. 
                     In essence, the training algorithm iterates over all text input and records the words that immediately follow specific sequences
                     of words. For our purposes, we used sequences of one, two and three. 
                <p>     
                     For example, if the 2-gram sequence (“The”, “world”) is 
                     followed by “is”, then “is” is added to the list of words that corresponds to the 2-gram sequence. Say later that (“The”, “world”) 
                     is followed by “was”, then “was” is added to the list. So the object for the 2-gram sequence has key (“The”, “world”) and value 
                     [“is”, “was”]. To then generate a fortune, we pick a random sequence to start with and then pick a random word from the value that
                     is associated with the sequence. We repeat this until we have a sequence that is not followed by any words. 
                     And you have your fortune! Try it yourself, if you're feeling lucky...
